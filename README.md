# machine-learning-moscow-housing-TDT4173

NTNU course TDT4173 - Machine learning

The moscowHousing folder is the final project in TDT4173 - Machine learning. The aim of the project is to predict prices of apartments in Moscow.

Two datasets were given as a basis: 1) real apartments data (apartments_train.csv) and 2) real buildings data (buildings_train.csv). The former constitutes the main data set, including 16 specific apartment attributes and the target value, price. The latter contributes with supplementary features about the buildings that the apartments are located in. Several apartments could belong to the same building.

The results from the prediction were submitted in Kaggle, taking part of the competition against virtual teams implemented by the course staff. By following the kaggle link:

you can see that our final submition ranked us in 6th place out of 61 groups, as our group was named "Fit Check (Group 55)".

There are 2 notebooks in this project, the long notebook will go step by step through the data explorations and modifications towards a merged dataset as well as model interpretations and predictors. The short Jupyter notebook contains only the necessary steps to reproduce your final predictions.

The assingment1 folder on the other are just two simple implementations of the machine learning algorithms k-means and logistic regression described in the PDF-file.
